    <h1>I am a passionate Robotics PhD graduate from Imperial College London, where I delved deeply into the fascinating world of robotics. My approach to learning is hands-on, believing firmly in the power of experiential knowledge. My expertise spans a diverse array of topics within the field, including the innovative design of perching mechanisms and morphing quadcopters. I possess a strong foundation in mechatronics and control systems, coupled with a keen proficiency in electronics design. Additionally, I have a significant background in supervised learning, which complements my technical skills. Below, I'm excited to share some of the projects that encapsulate my journey and achievements in robotics.</h1>
